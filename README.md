-- 1 List just the titles of all the movies in the database.

-- SELECT title
-- FROM movies;

-- 2 List the title and year of each movie in the database in DESCENDING order of the year released. (Hint: Combine the SELECT command with the ORDER BY keywords).
-- SELECT title , year_released
-- FROM movies
-- ORDER BY year_released DESC;

-- 3 List all columns for all records of the directors table in ASCENDING alphabetical order based on the director’s country of origin.
-- 
-- 
-- SELECT *
-- FROM directors
-- ORDER BY country ASC;
-- 
-- 4 ORDER BY can also consider multiple columns. List all columns for all records of the directors table in ASCENDING alphabetical order first by the director’s country of origin and then by the director’s last name.

-- SELECT * 
-- FROM directors
-- ORDER BY Country ASC, last_name ASC;

-- 5,Insert a new record into the directors table for Rob Reiner, an American film director.

--  INSERT INTO movies (title ,year_released ,director_id )
-- VALUES ("The Princess Bride", 1987 ,31);


-- 8,If you list all of the data from the movies table (SELECT * FROM movies;), you will see a column of director ID numbers. This data is not particularly helpful to a user, since they probably want to see the director names instead. Use an INNER JOIN in your SQL command to display a list of movie tit
-- les, years released, and director last names

-- SELECT * FROM movies; 
-- 
-- SELECT  title, year_released, last_name
-- FROM  movies
-- INNER JOIN directors ON movies.director_id=directors.director_id;

-- FROM movies
-- INNER JOIN directors ON movies.director_id=directors.director_id;



-- 10 List the first and last name for the director of The Incredibles. You can do this with either a join or a WHERE command, but for this step please use WHERE.

-- SELECT directors.first_name, directors.last_name
-- FROM directors, movies
-- WHERE directors.director_id = movies.director_id AND movies.title = "The Incredibles";


-- 11. List the last name and country of origin for the director of Roma. You can do this with either a join or a WHERE command, but for this step please use a join.
